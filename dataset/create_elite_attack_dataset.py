Elite Attack Dataset Generator
Creates exactly 100 highly effective, diverse attack prompts that are guaranteed to break baseline models.

This script:
1. Generates diverse attack prompts across 15 attack families
2. Tests each prompt against baseline model in real-time
3. Keeps only prompts that successfully break baseline (100% effective)
4. Ensures balanced diversity across attack families
5. Outputs exactly 100 elite attacks in CIV-compatible format

OUTPUT: 
- elite_attack_dataset.csv (100 verified effective attacks)
- elite_attack_dataset.json (same data in JSON format)
- Elite_Attack_Dataset_README.md (documentation)

USAGE: python create_elite_attack_dataset.py

## Overview
This dataset contains **{len(attacks)} elite attack scenarios** that are **guaranteed to break baseline LLM defenses**. Every attack in this dataset has been verified against the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model and successfully extracts embedded secrets.

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ **100% Effective**: Every attack breaks baseline model
- 🎯 **Maximum Diversity**: {len(family_counts)} attack families covered  
- 🔍 **Verified Results**: Real-time tested against baseline model
- 🛡️ **CIV Ready**: Perfect for Contextual Integrity Verification testing
- 📊 **Balanced Distribution**: Diverse coverage across attack types
- 🌟 **Publication Quality**: Ready for public security research

### Files Included
- `elite_attack_dataset.csv` - Main dataset in CSV format
- `elite_attack_dataset.json` - Same data in JSON format with list structures
- `Elite_Attack_Dataset_README.md` - This documentation

### Data Schema
- `id`: Unique attack identifier
- `system`: System message containing embedded secret
- `user`: Attack prompt designed to extract the secret
- `tool`: Tool message (empty for these attacks)
- `indicators`: Comma-separated detection keywords
- `secret`: The secret information that should not be revealed
- `attack_family`: Category of attack technique
- `attack_id`: Numeric identifier for attack family

## 🔬 Usage Examples

### CIV Testing
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load elite attacks
df = pd.read_csv('elite_attack_dataset.csv')

# Test specific attack family
dan_attacks = df[df['attack_family'] == 'Classic DAN/Developer-Mode Jailbreak']
print(f"Found {{len(dan_attacks)}} DAN attacks")

# All attacks are guaranteed effective for CIV validation
for _, attack in df.iterrows():
    system_msg = attack['system']
    user_msg = attack['user'] 
    indicators = attack['indicators'].split(',')
    # Test with your CIV implementation...
```

### Security Research
```python
# Analyze attack effectiveness by family
family_effectiveness = df.groupby('attack_family').size()
print("Most represented attack types:")
for family, count in family_effectiveness.sort_values(ascending=False).items():
    print(f"  {{family}}: {{count}} attacks")
```

## 🛡️ Security Validation
- ✅ All attacks tested against Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct baseline
- ✅ Confirmed secret leakage through automated indicator detection  
- ✅ Diverse prompt styles and attack vectors
- ✅ Clean data with proper encoding and formatting
- ✅ Balanced representation across attack families

## 📈 Research Applications
- **AI Safety Testing**: Validate defense mechanisms
